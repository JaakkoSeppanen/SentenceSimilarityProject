Use python 3
Tested with python 3.5.2 version

Install python packages:

pip3 install boto
pip install nltk
pip install matplotlib
pip install smart_open
pip install gensim
pip3 install cython
pip3 install git+git://github.com/gsi-upm/sematch.git

NOTE: sematch has to be installed from github, since otherwise you will get python2 version of the package and we need python3 version.




run "main.py" file. It will run all the tests and print the results.
